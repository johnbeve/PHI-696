Project 1

Your first project will require you to answer each of the 10 questions below.  You will be expected to open a pull request with your initial answers by the second class meeting, giving you one week to work on these problems. You and your peers will then have one week to work together to refine your respective initial answers, so they are ready for final submission. Once your pull requests have been reviewed and merged to the development branch, I will review them, then merge to the master branch.

Tip #1: Carefully study the Hedman selections assigned, as several of the questions are taken directly from the textbook. 

Tip #2: Google is your friend. An important skill to pick up in this class is recognizing when to think hard and when to think smart. You might find answers to some of the questions below simply by googling; you might find pieces of answers to parts of some question below, which will need to be combined; then again, you might not find any help at all because the questions are more novel than they initially appear. I encourage you to use existing resources as guidance, but be careful. My reputation for asking students tricky questions is well-earned. 

Tip #3: Work _together_ to solve these problems, even for initial submissions and when you do, document this in github. For example, you might feel like you nearly have answers to question 1, but would love another pair of eyes. You can then open a post in your local github account, and tag folks from class requesting they check out your work. 

Tip #4: The work we do is challenging; that should be assumed. You are smart enough to be here; that should also be assumed. We have neither time nor space for shaming, but all of time and space for praising. Be cognizant of how your messages might be received, and err on the side of caution. It is hard to surmise intent from text alone. For my part, I treat text only communications the way modern musicals are written: Little subtext; emotions on the sleeve.

Note: The standard interpretation of the logical symbols - "∨", "∧", "→", "¬", "∀", "∃" - is assumed throughout.

2. A literal is an atomic formula or the negation of an atomic formula. We say a formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it is the conjunction of the disjunction of literals. Find propositional logic formulas in CNF equivalent to each of the following:

(a) (A→B)→C

  (A v C) ^ (~B v C)     CNF

(b) (A→(BvC))v(C→~A)
  
  Already a tautology; CNF 
  A v ~A

(c) (¬A^¬B^C)v(¬A^¬C)v(B^C)vA
  
  Already a tautology; CNF  
  A v ~A


3. Let V be the vocabulary of first-order logic consisting of a binary relation P and a unary relation F. Interpret P(x,y) as “x is a parent of y” and F(x) as “x is female.” Where possible define the following formulas in this vocabulary; where not possible, explain why:

(a)  B(x,y) that says that x is a brother of y 
  
  B(x,y) ≡ ∀z (P(z,x) ∧ P(z,y) ∧ (Fx → ¬F(y)) ∧ (Fy → ¬F(x)) ∧ ¬(x=y))

(b)  A(x,y) that says that x is an aunt of y  
  
  A(x,y) ≡ ∃z∃w∃v ((P(z,x) ∧ ∃u(P(z,u) ∧ P(u,w) ∧ F(w))) ∨ (P(v,x) ∧ ∃u(P(v,u) ∧ P(u,w) ∧ P(w,y) ∧ F(w) ∧ ¬P(z,v))) ∧ ¬F(x))

(c)  C(x,y) that says that x and y are cousins   
  
  C(x,y) ≡ ∃u ∃v (P(u,x) ∧ P(v,y) ∧ ¬(u = x) ∧ ¬(v = y) ∧ ∃w ∃t (P(w,u) ∧ P(w,v) ∧ P(t,w) ∧ P(t,t) ∧ ¬P(t,u) ∧ ¬P(t,v)))

(d)  O(x) that says that x is an only child  
  
  Def.  ∃x∃y∀z(P(y,z)→z=x)

(e)  T(x) that says that x has exactly two brothers
  
  Def.  ∃v∃w∃x∃y∀z(P(v,x)^P(v,w)^¬F(w)^P(v,y)^¬F(y)^∀z((P(v,z)^¬F(z))→((z=x)v(z=w)v(z=y))))


4. Let V be a vocabulary of the attribute (concept) language with complements (ALC) consisting of a role name "parent_of" and a concept name "Male". 
Interpret parent_of as "x is a parent of y" and M as "x is male". Where possible define the following formulas in this vocabulary; where not possible, 
explain why:

(a)  B that says that x is a brother of y

***ALC is not expressive enough, so this is not interpretable in ALC; however, here's an attempt in ALCIN:

Person ≡ M ⊔ ¬M
p2 (parent of at least 2 children) ≡ ∃parent_of.Person≥2
[n.b., The inverse of p2 means, I take it, that 2 children have a parent; not sure how to specify that it is the same parent.]

B ≡ M ⊓ ∃p2¯.Person

(b)  A that says that x is an aunt of y

***ALC is not expressive enough, so this is not interpretable in ALC; however, here's an attempt in ALCIN:

A ≡ ¬M ⊓ (∃p2¯.(parent_of≥ 2. (∃parent_of. Person)) ⊔ ¬∃parent_of.Person)

(c)  C that says that x and y are cousins

***ALC is not expressive enough, so this is not interpretable in ALC; however, here's an attempt in ALCIN:

gp2 (Grandparent with at least two children-parents) ≡ parentof≥2. (∃parentof.Person)
  
C ≡ gp2¯.Person
  
(d)  O that says that x is an only child  

***ALC is not expressive enough, so this is not interpretable in ALC; however, here's an attempt in ALCIN:

parent_only (parent of exactly one child) ≡ (parent_of.Person≥1 ) ⊓ (parent_of.Person≤1)

O ≡ ∃parent_only¯.Person

(e)  T that says that x has exactly two brothers

***ALC is not expressive enough, so this is not interpretable in ALC; however, here's an attempt in ALCIN:

p3m (parent of exactly three male children) ≡ (parent_of≥3.Male) ⊓ (parent_of≥3. Male) 

T ≡ ∃p3m¯.Person


5. Select two formulas defined in ALC from question 4 to form the basis of a T-Box. Supplement this T-box with whatever other axioms you like, 
as well as an A-box, so that you ultimately construct a knowledge base K = (T,A). Provide a model of K. This may be graphical or symbolic or both.

K = (T, A)      

(a)  B that says that [w] is a brother of [x]
(b)  A that says that [y] is an aunt of [w]

T.box= {Brother ⊆ Male    (TBox.a)
	Aunt ⊆ ~Male}	  (TBox.b)

A.box=  {John: Bro ∩ male            (Ax1)
         Paul: Bro ∩ male            (Ax2)
         Jane: Aunt ∩ ~Male          (Ax3) 
         (Joan, John): parent_of     (Ax4)
         (Joan, Paul): parent_of     (Ax5)
         (Jane, John): aunt_of}      (Ax6)
            
ΔI = {w, x, y, z}

John = w
Paul = x
Jane = y
Joan = z

Male = {w, x}
Female/Other non-male: {y,z}

Brother = {w, x}
Aunt = {y}
Nephew = {w}
Parent_of = {(z,w), (z,x)}
Aunt_of = {(y,w), (y,x)}  


  
6. Explain the difference - using natural language - between the first-order prefixes:

(a) ∃x∀y and ∀x∃y

  ∃x∀y means “there is--or exists--some x such that for all y…”, and ∀x∃y means “For all x, there is some y that…”

(b) ∃x∀y∃z and ∀x∃y∀z 

  ∃x∀y∃z means “there is an x for all y, there is some z such that…”, whereas ∀x∃y∀z means “for all x there is some y, so that for all z…” 

(c) ∀x∃y∀z∃w and ∃x∀y∃z∀w

  ∀x∃y∀z∃w means “for all x there is some y for all z, there exists some w such that…”,  and ∃x∀y∃z∀w means “there is some x such that for all y, 
  there is some z such that for all w…”



7. Show that the following sentences are not equivalent by exhibiting a graph that models one but not both of these sentences:

∀x∃y∀z(R(x,y) ∧ R(x,z) ∧ R(y,z))
∃x∀y∃z(R(x,y) ∧ R(x,z) ∧ R(y,z))


graph LR 

  0 ----> 1 ----> 2
   `--------------^
  
  U: {0,1,2}
  R: {(0,1),(0,2),(1,2)}
  
  
  
8. Using an online tableau proof generator - such as the one found here https://www.umsu.de/trees/ - provide tree proofs of the following entailments, 
which are known as the De Morgan's laws:

(a) ∀x∀y(¬(Px ∧ Qx) → (¬Px ∨ ¬Qx))

<img src="blob:chrome-untrusted://media-app/55dfa8c9-4008-4723-9c14-e4c8b00119b0" alt="Project1_8a.png"/>

(b) ∀x∀y(¬(Px ∨ Qx) → (¬Px ∧ ¬Qx))

<img src="blob:chrome-untrusted://media-app/194c99fb-ce2a-4179-993c-c32977d41d22" alt="Project1_8b.png"/>

(c) ∀x∀y((¬Px ∨ ¬Qx) → ¬(Px ∧ Qx))

<img src="blob:chrome-untrusted://media-app/881a5014-e7c7-4e8a-8486-c618d6fc2ce1" alt="Project1_8c.png"/>

(d) ∀x∀y((¬Px ∧ ¬Qx) → ¬(Px ∨ Qx))

<img src="blob:chrome-untrusted://media-app/70839ba3-e6ee-4825-a3bf-0af154c94388" alt="Project1_8d.png"/>



9. Using a natural deduction proof generator - such as the one found here https://proofs.openlogicproject.org/ - provide natural deduction proofs for each of De Morgan's laws.

(a) ¬(Px ∧ Qx) → (¬Px ∨ ¬Qx)

10. Compare and contrast the proofs provided for (a) in your answers to questions 8 and 9. Explain the different assumptions, strategies, etc. exhibited in tree proofs vs natural deduction proofs.

In a tableau proof like the one given in 8(a), each formula is represented as a node in a tree-like structure, with branches representing different ways of decomposing the formula. The goal is to determine whether a given formula is a logical consequence of a set of premises by constructing a tableau in which every branch closes, meaning that it leads to a contradiction. The program's algorithm follows a set of rules for decomposing formulas, constructing branches, and determining when a branch can be closed. It then generates a proof tree that can be used to verify the validity of an argument or to find counterexamples. Natural deduction proofs like that in 9(a), on the other hand, are a system of inference rules for constructing proofs directly from premises, without the need for a graphical representation. In a natural deduction proof like this one, each step of the proof is justified by applying a rule of inference to one or more formulas in the proof so far. The goal is to derive the conclusion from the premises using a sequence of valid inference rules. One advantage of natural deduction proofs is that they are more intuitive and closely resemble the way humans reason about logical arguments. Natural deduction proofs can also provide more insight into the structure of a proof and the underlying assumptions being made. 

There are some key differences between the two proof systems as seen respectively in 8(a) and 9(a). One of the main differences is that 8(a) uses a strategy of proof by refutation, where the goal is to show that a formula is false or contradictory. The natural deduction proof in 9(a), on the other hand, use a strategy of proof by derivation, where the goal is to show that a formula can be derived from a set of premises. Another difference is the way in which the two proof systems handle quantifiers. In tableau proofs, quantifiers are typically handled using a method called "instantiation," where the formula is decomposed into all possible instantiations of the quantifier. In natural deduction proofs, quantifiers are typically handled using rules of inference such as universal generalization or existential instantiation.

***Importantly, there are differences in the structures of tableau proofs and natural deduction proofs, as seen in 8(a) and 9(a) respectively. Tableau proofs are represented as trees, with each node representing a formula and each branch representing a possible path of decomposition of the formula. In a tableau proof, the goal is to show that a contradiction can be derived by expanding the tree until all branches are closed. If all branches can be closed, then the proof is successful and the formula is shown to be a logical consequence of the premises. Natural deduction proofs, on the other hand, are represented as a sequence of formulas, with each formula being justified by applying a rule of inference to the previous formulas in the sequence. In a natural deduction proof, the goal is to show that the conclusion can be derived from the premises by applying a sequence of valid inference rules. The structures of the proofs generated by these respective two systems can, therefore, look quite different, even when they are proving the same argument. Tableau proofs tend to be more visual and can provide a more intuitive understanding of the argument, while natural deduction proofs tend to be more concise and provide a step-by-step explanation of how the argument is constructed.
