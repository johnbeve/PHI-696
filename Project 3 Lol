# Project 3

Your third project will require you to answer each of the 10 questions below.  You will be expected to open a pull request with your initial answers by the second class meeting, giving you one week to work on these problems. You and your peers will then have one week to work together to refine your respective initial answers, so they are ready for final submission. Once your pull requests have been reviewed and merged to the development branch, I will review them, then merge to the master branch. 

```
For any question involving the use of Protege, please be sure to import Basic Formal Ontology (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/v2019-08-26/bfo_classes_only.owl) and the Relations Ontology (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oborel/obo-relations/master/ro.owl)
```

1. In BFO and RO identify at least one object property for each of a-e that _should have the listed property, but which does not_; argue for your case, using examples. 
``` 
  (a)  Reflexive
  - "has characteristic" should be a reflexive object property because everything has itself as a characteristic. 
  -  I have myself as a characteristic: being myself distinguishes me from other people and things.
  
  (b)  Transitive 
 - "immersed in" should be a transitive object property.
 - If object a is immersed in fluid b, and fluid b is immersed in fluid c, then object a is immersed in fluid c.
 - I am also interpreting "immersed in" as one type of the "located in" relation, which is listed as a transitive object property.
 
  (c)  Symmetric
 - I am confused about the "before or simultaneous with" relation because I do not understand why those relationships are not kept separate.
 - "simultaneous with" should definitely be a symmetric temporal relation.
  
  (d)  Functional 
 - I think "has prototype" should be a functional object property.
 - If a prototype is "some instance of a 'canonical'" entity, I am assuming there is only one prototype for every entity of interest.
 
  (e)  Symmetric and Reflexive
 - "overlaps" seems symmetric and reflexive to me (I got help from the project 3 Google doc on this one).
  
```

2. In BFO and RO identify at least one object property for each of a-e that _should not have the listed property, but which does_; argue for your case, using examples. 
```
  (a)  Irreflexive
  (b)  Transitive 
  (c)  Asymmetric
 -  "has role in modeling" is an asymmetric relationship between information about an entity and the entity of interest.
 - I feel like if the entity of interest is also information, the two could hold a symmetric relationship.
 - Like, does the information in the left circle of a venn diagram have a role in modeling the right side?

  (d)  Functional 
 - "characteristic of" is a functional relationship between a characteristic and the relevant bearer.
 - Isn't a functional object property limited to only a singular two-place relation? like, according to RO, a bearer can only have at most one characteristic?
 - I am confused about this object property because I believe a bearer can have as many characteristics as anybody feels like identifying.
 
  (e)  Inverse Functional
 - "has characteristic" is an inverse-functional relationship between a bearer and the relevant characteristic.
 - I am confused about this object property because I believe a bearer can have as many characteristics as anybody feels like identifying.
 
```

3. Model the following natural language expressions using terms from BFO and RO; you are welcome to introduce new terms where needed:  
```
  (a) Sally has an arm Tuesday but does not have an arm Wednesday. 
  - There is a process profile describing Sally's arm (an object) as part_of Sally's body (an object) on Tuesday (...), then (...( being separate from her body within the next 24 hours.
  
  (b) Every liver has some cell as part at all times it exists.
  
  (c) John was a child, then an adult, then a senior. 
  - There is a history of John's life, modeling John's lifespan (process profile) as three discrete chunks (...).
  - There is John's childhood (...), followed by (...) John's adult life (...), followed by John's senior years (...)
  
  (d) Goofus and Gallant are married at each point in a three year span. 
  
```

4. Using the language of First-Order Logic, represent the following natural language expressions; you are welcome to introduce new terms where needed: 
```
  (a) Sally has an arm Tuesday but does not have an arm Wednesday. 
  ∃Tues.B(S,A) ∧ Wed.B(S,¬A)
  - 'There exists a Tuesday with Sally bodying an arm and there is a Wednesday with Sally bodying a not-arm.'
  
  (b) Every liver has some cell as part at all times it exists.
  ∀Liver.C
  - 'All Livers have a Cell'
  - I don't know how to represent "at all times it exists" in FOL; I was thinking "all livers do not have a not-cell" but that either doesn't make sense, is redundant, or both.
  
  (c) John was a child, then an adult, then a senior. 
  ∃John.Child ∧ John.Grown ∧ John.Old ∧ John.¬(Child ∧ Grown ∧ Old)
  - 'There exists John as child and John as grown and John as old, and John not-as (child and grown and old), and none of these variables equal each other.'
  - I don't know how to represent the "was" and "then" relations in FOL; I was thinking 
  
  (d) Goofus and Gallant have been married for three years; for each day of that span, it is true to assert they are married. 
  
```

5. Using BFO and RO, model the following scenario: the content of an rdf file is represented in two serializations - one in Turtle, one in XML - which are sent from one computer to two distinct computers on the same network.   
"the content of an rdf file"

6. Using Protege, place these in the BFO hierarchy where you think they fit best:
```
  (a) Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier
  - Process
  - the sheet music, along with any physical representation of the song (including recordings), are generically dependent continuants.
  
  (b) Chair of the UB Philosophy Department
  - Role
  -- The many chairs inside the UB Philosophy Department fiat object part of UB's campus are objects.
  
  (c) SARS-CoV-2
  - object
  
  (d) Mexico City
  - object aggregate made up of objects like inhabitants, buildings, streets, lights, smells, and et cetera.
  - What I am confused about here is whether or not an object aggregate must be aggregated of all the same object, as this is the case with the examples listed in chapter 5.
  
  (e) The trunk of a minivan
  - fiat object part
  - page 113 lists "the trunk of your car" as an example of a site.
  
  (f) Occupation
  - Depends, the position, as in the formal title, is a role. 
  - The conditions and expectations set around a position are generically dependent continuants about the role.
  - the actual work done, one's occupation of their time, is a process.
  
  (g) Ocean
  - fiat object part
  
  (h) Lake
  - fiat object part
  
- My answers for (g) and (h) are informed by the attached article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263775817700395.
- I've heard Giacomo and Ali categorize both oceans and lakes as sites according to BFO. I support this categorization.
  
```

7. True or False; explain your answers:
```
  (a) An instance of Material Entity can have an instance of Immaterial Entity as part.
  - True: I think holes and cavities are immaterial entities.
  - My answer here is informed by chapter 5 of the BFO textbook as well as the attached slides: https://buffalo.app.box.com/s/6wmxnd9vvuhd9ubrldeptaerydqzkbct
  
  (b) An instance of Immaterial Entity can have an instance of Material Entity as part.
  - True: an imaginary friend is in a symmetric parthood relationship with the mind of the child who imagines it.
  - This is also written as being the case on page 112 of the BFO textbook.
  
  (c) An organization may have another organization as part.
  - True: if we assume the opposite ("An organization CANNOT have another organization as part"), then I would never make friends in my classes or work in groups.
  - Many social organizations only exist insofar as the smaller social organizations constituting them continue to exist.
  
  (d) An organization may have no members as part. 
  - True: if nobody attends Anime Club on a given week, it still exists, both as a formal title and as an empty room.
  - Unless its founders or relevant organizers dissolve it after weeks of nobody attending, Anime Club continues to exist as an organization with no members.
  
  (e) Any site is partially bounded by some instance of Material Entity.
  - True: a fully immaterial site, one not bounded to anything 'out there', cannot exist in the world. 
  - I am under the impression that a site is a 'de jure' entity; it only exists because we pay special attention to it/ give it a name.
  - We cannot demarcate a site around something wholly immaterial. 
  
  (f) A book placed under the leg of a wobbly table has acquired a new function. 
  - False: function is a specifically dependent quality; it is unique to the continuant which bears it.
  - Many other objects can be placed under the table, like a brick, or two other, thinner books.
  - Because stabilizing a table is a generic quality, the book has acquired a new role.
  
  (g) A glass vase cushioned with packing tape for all time, has the disposition to break. 
  - True: the glass vase itself has the disposition to break, regardless of individual circumstance.
  - The 'vase-and-packing-tape' is an instance of a new type of 'cushioned object', which may not have the disposition to break.
  
  (h) Spacetime is a class in BFO.
  - False: I cannot provide an explanation using theories in physics.
  - I have an intuition that spacetime cannot be represented in BFO because a spacial region is a continuant while a temporal region is an occurent.
  
  (i) The continuant fiat boundary class of BFO is closed, meaning, there are no subclasses beyond those identified presently in BFO.
  - I support Finn's assertion in the project 3 google doc that any of the given fiat boundary subclasses can be further subclassified according to a given domain and according to different granularities.
  - Like, measurements of a fiat boundary could subclassify them further, for example.
  
```
8. Model the following scenario in BFO, introducing whatever terms are needed to do so: John runs for 3 hours, startin slowly, speeding up during the middle, then ending the run at a slower pace.  
John is_a object
John_run is_a process
John_runtime is_a generically dependent continuant
John_runpace is_a process profile with parts warmup, stride and cooldown
John_runner'shigh is_a quality

9. The Pellet reasoner in Protege can be used in an incremental reasoning strategy. ELI5 when and why one should use Pellet for incremental reasoning. 

10. Protege reasoners will not allow you to combine certain properties, e.g. reflexivity and transitivity. If you attempt to assert such pairs of the same object property, then run the reasoner, nothing will happen. If you combine such properties while a reasoner is running, then ask to synchronize the reasoner, an error will be thrown. Provide a table or series of tables illustrating which pairs of properties cannot be combined in Protege, either because nothing happens when the reasoenr is run or because an error is thrown when synchronizing a reasoner after making such changes. Review the github docs on [creating tables in markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables).
