# Project 3

Your third project will require you to answer each of the 10 questions below.  You will be expected to open a pull request with your initial answers by the second class meeting, giving you one week to work on these problems. You and your peers will then have one week to work together to refine your respective initial answers, so they are ready for final submission. Once your pull requests have been reviewed and merged to the development branch, I will review them, then merge to the master branch. 

```
For any question involving the use of Protege, please be sure to import:
1. Basic Formal Ontology (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/v2019-08-26/bfo_classes_only.owl)
2. The Relations Ontology (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oborel/obo-relations/master/ro.owl)
```

1. In BFO and RO identify at least one object property for each of a-e that _should have the listed property, but which does not_; argue for your case, using examples. Note: It will be easiest to view the object properties in BFO and RO using Protege. 
```
  (a)  Reflexive
      -Simultaneous_with. Any time is simultaneous with itself. It wouldn't make sense for there to be a time that occurs at a different time from itself.
      
  (b)  Transitive 
      -Causally_influences. If one entity causally influences one thing, and it causally influences another, then the original has causally influenced the last, albeit indirectly.
      
  (c)  Symmetric
      -Aligned_with. If a block A is placed in alignment with block B, then it's true that A is aligned with B and B is aligned with A. This works for political alignments. If one party is aligned with another, the reverse is also true. Otherwise, they weren't really in alignment.
      
  (d)  Functional 
      -Has_relative_magnitude. Relative to some entity, and object has a single, particular magnitude.
       
  (e)  Symmetric and Reflexive
      -Simultaneous_with. I've already explained why this should be reflexive. It's also reflexive, since if t1 is simultaneous with t2, then t2 is also simultaneous with t1.
      
```

2. In BFO and RO identify at least one object property for each of a-e that _should not have the listed property, but which does_; argue for your case, using examples. Note: It will be easiest to view the object properties in BFO and RO using Protege.
```
  (a)  Irreflexive
      -Has_role_in_modelling. Imagine a machine that is designed to model aspects of itself. It can be used to study itself, in virtue of its ability to reflect aspects of itself.
      
  (b)  Transitive 
      -Aligned_with. Imagine two lines of blocks that intersect at block B. Call one row 'Vertical' and the other 'Horizontal'. A is a block in Vertical, but not Horizontal. C is a block in Horizontal, but not Vertical. And B is in both Vertical and Horizontal. A is aligned with B, since they're in the same row, and B is aligned with C for the same reason, but A is not aligned with B.
      
  (c)  Asymmetric
      -Has_role_in_modelling. Imagine two machines that are designed to model aspects of eachother. They can be used to study eachother, in virtue of their ability to reflect aspects of eachother.
  
  (d)  Functional 
      -Phenotype_of. The color of an eye is a phenotype of the eye and of the person it belongs to. As a result, there is not exactly one entity it's in this relation to.
  
  (e)  Inverse Functional
      -Has_characteristic. A smile is a characteristic of a face, but also of a person. So characteristic_of is non-functional. So has_characteristic is not inverse functional.
      
```

3. Model the following natural language expressions using terms from BFO and RO; you are welcome to introduce new terms where needed:  
```
  (a) Sally has an arm Tuesday but does not have an arm Wednesday. 
  
  
  (b) Every liver has some cell as part at all times it exists.
  
  
  (c) John was a child, then an adult, then a senior. 
  (d) Goofus and Gallant are married at each point in a three year span. 
```

4. Using the language of First-Order Logic, represent the following natural language expressions; you are welcome to introduce new terms where needed: 
```
  (a) Sally has an arm Tuesday but does not have an arm Wednesday. 
  ∀x (Tx→(∃y(Hsy∧Ay))∧(Wx→~∃y(Hsy∧Ay)))
  T: is a Tuesday
  H: has a
  A: is an arm
  W: is a Wednesday
  
  (b) Every liver has some cell as part at all times it exists.
  ∀x∃y(Lx→Cy∧Pyx)
  L: is a liver
  C: is a cell
  P: is a part of
  
  (c) John was a child, then an adult, then a senior. 
  (d) Goofus and Gallant have been married for three years; for each day of that span, it is true to assert they are married. 
```

5. Using BFO and RO, model the following scenario: the content of an rdf file is represented in two serializations - one in Turtle, one in XML - which are sent from one computer to two distinct computers on the same network.   


6. Using Protege, place these in the BFO hierarchy where you think they fit best:
```
  (a) Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier
  -generically dependent continuent
  (b) Chair of the UB Philosophy Department
  -role
  (c) SARS-CoV-2
  -object
  (d) Mexico City
  -object aggregate
  (e) The trunk of a minivan
  -fiat object part
  (f) Occupation
  -role
  (g) Ocean
  -object aggregate
  (h) Lake
  -object aggregate
  
```

7. True or False; explain your answers:
```
  (a) An instance of Material Entity can have an instance of Immaterial Entity as part.
  True, thoughts are not material, since they can have different properties from the material brain, and they are a part of material organisms. Or, a nostrile is an immaterial part of a material organism.
  
  (b) An instance of Immaterial Entity can have an instance of Material Entity as part.
  (c) An organization may have another organization as part.
  True,
  
  (d) An organization may have no members as part. 
  False, definition excludes this
  
  (e) Any site is partially bounded by some instance of Material Entity.
  False, definition excludes this
  
  (f) A book placed under the leg of a wobbly table has acquired a new function. 
  False, definition excludes this, that sucks 
  
  (g) A glass vase cushioned with packing material for all time, has the disposition to break. 
  True
  
  (h) Spacetime is a class in BFO.
  False, it's a spatiotemporal region
  
  (i) The continuant fiat boundary class of BFO is closed, meaning, there are no subclasses beyond those identified presently in BFO. 
  True, any subclass of two-dimensional continuant fiat boundary
```

8. Model the following scenario in BFO, introducing whatever terms are needed to do so: John runs for 3 hours, startin slowly, speeding up during the middle, then ending the run at a slower pace.  

9. The Pellet reasoner in Protege can be used in an incremental reasoning strategy. ELI5 when and why one should use Pellet for incremental reasoning. 

10. Protege reasoners will not allow you to combine certain properties, e.g. reflexivity and transitivity. If you attempt to assert such pairs of the same object property, then run the reasoner, nothing will happen. If you combine such properties while a reasoner is running, then ask to synchronize the reasoner, an error will be thrown. Provide a table or series of tables illustrating which pairs of properties cannot be combined in Protege, either because nothing happens when the reasoenr is run or because an error is thrown when synchronizing a reasoner after making such changes. Review the github docs on [creating tables in markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables).
